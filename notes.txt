Major Issues
what the fuck is going on with delta time?
maybe more granular values provided on one computer allow
for linear acceleration to be more effective than on computers
with less granularity.
Nope, adding a delay at the start of frames I approximated crossing the first room
with 1ms of delay it took a bit over 2 seconds
with 10ms of delay it took about 10 seconds
with 100ms of delay it took about 90 seconds
clearly something else is going on here

Minor Issues
Against the right side of a wall visual bug


General
Platforming QoL
corner alignment helping
wall jump from a few pixels away like celeste?
interlaced horizontal and vertical movement steps?
actually good jump physics
balancing physics - maybe make it adjustable on the fly for easier testing

Visual
Colour keying
New art
animated sprites

Sound
???
music?

Levels
multiple levels / level loading?
